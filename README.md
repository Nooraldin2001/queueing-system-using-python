# Queue Simulation Application

This is a simple Python application that simulates a single-server queuing system and provides visualization of average wait times and delay times over time using a graphical user interface (GUI).

## Features
- Allows users to input simulation parameters such as total time, job arrival rate, and job service rate.
- Simulates a single-server queuing system based on the input parameters.
- Generates random inter-arrival times and service times based on exponential distributions.
- Tracks the wait times and delay times experienced by jobs in the system.
- Provides visualization of the average wait times and delay times over time using matplotlib.
- Implemented using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and Tkinter for GUI.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:

3. Run the application by executing the `queue_simulation.py` file:

4. Input the simulation parameters in the GUI window and click on the "Simulate" button to run the simulation.
5. After the simulation is complete, you can click on the "Plot Wait Times" and "Plot Delay Times" buttons to visualize the results.

## Test Cases
The application provides the following test cases to validate the behavior of the queue simulation:
1. Normal Case
2. High Arrival Rate
3. Low Arrival Rate
4. Equal Arrival and Service Rates
5. Zero Arrival Rate
6. Zero Service Rate
